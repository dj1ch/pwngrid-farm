# pwngrid-farm

a POC that bypasses Pwngrid's system to find unique pwned networks based on a Mac address.

## A quick note

I do not support using such devices, projects, etc related to this. If you get into any sort of issues or problems with Pwnagotchi-Unofficial or Pwngrid maintainers, it is **NOT** my responsibility to fix those issues. In any given scenario where you are in this sort of situation, I would recommend consulting with maintainers to achieve a solution. 

**You have been warned.**
